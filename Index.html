<h1>CardioMEMS</h1>

<center>
<p>An implantable device to measure pulmonary pressures in ambulatory patients</p>
<p>Allows for detection of elevated filling pressure, which can enable dose adjustment to target more adequate filling pressures with the hopes of preventing cardiac/pulmonary congestion and decompensation leading to hospitalzation</p>
<p>The CHAMPION trial demonstrated that implantation of CardioMEMS in patients with NYHA Class III heart failure and subsequent long term hemodynamic monitoring with associated medication dosage adjustment can lead to reductions in hospitalizations. There was also a strong trend towards reduced mortality in the overall heart failure population.</p>
